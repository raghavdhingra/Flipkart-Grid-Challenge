# Flipkart-Grid-Challenge

**#Introduction**

This is our submission repository for the Flipkart Grid 3.0 Robotics Challenge. We were asked to create 4 robots, that can autonomously drop cargo at the designated spots. We started off with a lot of brainstorming sessions, worked out different approaches, to finally test out the approach that we found the best. 
We started off by purchasing the required hardware, and then building the robots on cardboard pieces. The hardware team used their innovative ideas to create the most appropriate bots suited for this role.
While the software team, then started off with the coding, that runs the robots on the grid. This was done with OpenCV, Arduino IDE, and various python libraries. We will be detailing all the tools used, further in the documentation.
